# radio_api

Simple mplayer-based radio player controllable via REST API

## Overview

Stations are stored with their **URL** in a **SQLite** database.

## Requirements

For using this application, you will need:

- Python 3
- Flask
- SQLite 3

## Docker container

There is a [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) for running this application inside a container based on [Ubuntu Linux](https://www.ubuntu.com).
To create the image, run the following command:

```shell
$ docker build -t radio .
```

This will take a couple of minutes, afterwards you should see the image:
```shell
$ docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
radio               latest              84572d3b8826        1 hour ago          504.8MB
...
```

To start a new container based on this image, execute:

```shell
$ docker run -d -p 5000:5000 radio
b4735f102afb6e288b0a35d17b0e63da4d6bd2652467709c5c28538088ae5d30

$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                      COMMAND                   CREATED             STATUS                PORTS                                                                                                  NAMES
b4735f102afb        radio                      "/bin/sh -c \"/opt/joâ€¦"   16 seconds ago      Up 14 seconds         0.0.0.0:5000->5000/tcp                                                                                 boring_chebyshev
...
```

It is also possible to use shipped [docker-compose file](docker-compose.yml):

```shell
$ docker-compose create
$ docker-compose up
Starting radio ... done
Attaching to radio
...
radio       |  * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
